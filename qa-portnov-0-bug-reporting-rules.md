**Bug Reporting Rules**

- Do not assume all the companies have same approach to writing bug reports

- Rule of WWW – What happened, Where it happened, under Which circumstances

- “Problem” bug report versus “Solution” bug report

- Bug report is not about perfect English

- Before reporting a bug, make sure that you are using the latest version of the AUT

- Report a bug immediately, do not postpone

- Make sure the bug is reproducible before reporting

- Minimize number of steps-to-reproduce

- Write one bug report for each fix to be verified

- The difference between actual and expected results should be clear

- Do not quote the violated rules or requirements (developers know them) – just talk about the problem itself

- Do not assume developer knows less than you do about the application

- Bug reports should be as concise as possible

- Bug report should be as complete as possible

- Attach screen shots, data files, logs to clarify the bug description

- Each “problem” has a story (each decision is a compromise) research before reporting

- Use technical terms, not “people off the street” language
